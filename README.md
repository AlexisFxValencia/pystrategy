05_11_23:
- cleaning object creation and separation of map objects and buildings of the player.
- numerical constants in a separate python file

04_11_23:
 - active/passive color
 - inheritance of a peon from place (which choose be called GameObject)
 - uniformisation of object selection with the mouse
 - design : surrounding ring to select an object rather than changing its color
 - ability to create a peon from town
